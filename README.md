# Wristimate
Wristimate is an H3VR mod that displays imprecise information about magazines on the wrist of your hand. This occurs on the wrist you are holding
the magazine with, and only happens when you look at your wrist. It currently supports displaying the percentage of remaining rounds, as well as
the caliber and class of the next round to be fed.
